# Star Power! ü§©

This is the GitHub repository containing all the resources from my independent project
for my graph theory course (MATH 725 for any fellow Jayhawks out there). For this project,
I read "A Formal Basis for the Heuristic Determination of Minimum Cost Paths" by Hart, Nilsson, and
Raphael which is the original paper that proposed the `A*` heuristic algorithm for minimum-weight
paths in weighted, directed graphs. Afterwards, I wrote a short report, implemented the algorithm, and
gave a talk in class.

In here you will find:

- The LaTeX source for my project report in `report/`
-  An implementation of the `A*` algorithm using Python in `implementation/`

I hope you enjoy your stay! üòÅ
